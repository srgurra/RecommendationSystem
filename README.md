# RecommendationSystem
This project develops the scholarly paper based recommendation system using Machine Learning Algorithms


ALGORITHM:

The data of 3000 scholarly papers, some or interlinked( scholarly papers are referenced to each other or of same topic or of same Author) and others are not. 

The data cleaning process is done in order to remove some invalid data.

Embeddings are created for the data, in which text data will get converted to 64 coordinates

Applied KNN Algoirithm to find the accuracy of the recommendation and also compared with the earlier method of just recommendation based on references.
